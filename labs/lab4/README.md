# Setting up Hipster Shop

For our Hands-On, you will need to run <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo">Hipster Shop</a> which is a Google sample application.

### 1. Run the Hipster Shop

```bash
wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dynatrace-APAC/Workshop-Kubernetes/master/deploy.sh | bash
```

Once deployed, you can locate the front-end endpoint from GCP (<b>Kubernetes Engine -> Services & Ingress</b>)

Once running, you can go to the exposed frontend-external IP to go to Hipster Shop.
